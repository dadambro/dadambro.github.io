# Hello!
My name is Damon D'Ambrosio. I am currently working at a large agriculture company in Research Triangle Park, NC. I am enrolled in ST 558 as the final course in my Applied Statistics and Data Management graduate certificate program.

When I am not working (job or class) I am usually doing one of the following:
- Hanging out with my family
- Tending to my flock of chickens
- Home improvement projects
